Probabilistic Reasoning. Repository for Labs 1 and 2

Lab 1: Classification with Binary and Gaussian Models

1.  Naıve Bayes Classifier for Spam Filtering (classifier)
  - A Naıve Bayes Classifier was implemented and trained on emails to detect whether the set was SPAM or HAM (Not SPAM).
  - Analyzed Type I - Type II Tradeoff Curve to minimize misclassification of HAM emails 
2. Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis for Height/Weight Data (Idaqda)
  - Guassian Vectors were used to create two models (Linear & Quadratic) to classify the gender (Male/Female) provided a given Height and Weight data.

Lab 2:

1. Bayesian Linear Regression
  - provided a 2-D linear model with Guassian noise, a Bayesian Linear Model was implemented to predict this linear function, provided a certain number of points used to train.

2. Hidden Markov Model
  - Given a 2-D space with initial, final positions and noisy observations, two Models were implemented using the Forward-Backward and Veterbi Algorithms to predict the location at any given time t.
